Ten different datasets are shared here, which together comprise the processed data needed for the main analyses in the paper.

File details:

-----
Camera_Positives.csv

Metadata associated with all detections of hunters on cameras. One row per photograph. Columns:
Station - Location ID.
DateTime - Time Stamp.
Positive - 1's since these were positive detections.
NHunters - number of hunters in the frame.
Comments - extra comments made by the transcriber.


-----
EnergyDetector_GLMM.csv

Acoustic detection data collapsed to daily detection histories for running GLMM. One row per station-day. Columns:
Station - Location ID.
Gunshots - Count of gunshots detected at that station on that day (after filtering clusters, see paper).
Julian - Julian date (2018).
Hours - Number of hours the ARU recorded that day.
Distance - Distance to nearest access point, in meters.
Weekday - Day of the week.
Major - ID of the nearest of the four major staging areas.

-----
EnergyDetector_Hits.csv

Raw acoustic detection data generated by the energy detector. Since some sound sources (especially wind/rain) tended to generate many "hits" in a short period of time, adjacent detections were collapsed prior to review, generally into 7-second or 12-second chunks of recording (but all gunshots were counted individually). 

Filename - Path to file. Files named according to convention station_date_time.wav
Station - Station ID.
TimeOffset - Time of start of detection within the file (minutes:seconds)
Duration - Duration of detection in seconds.
Gunshots - Time offset of a gunshot, relative to the start of the detection. Multiple gunshots separated by a space.
Positive - Indicator variable, whether one or more gunshots were detected.


-----
EnergyDetector_Positives.csv & Recognizer_Hits.csv & Recognizer_Positives.csv & 
ManualScan_Positives

Raw acoustic detection data generated with the energy detector, recognizer or manual scanning methods.

Filename - Path to file. Files named according to convention station_date_time.wav
Station - Station ID.
TimeOffset - Time of start of detection within the file (minutes:seconds)
Duration - Duration of detection in seconds. Energy detector and manual scanning detections were assigned a value of 0.5.
Positive - Indicator variable, whether one or more gunshots were detected.
RSL - Relative sound level (dB).


-----
ManualScan_RecordingList.csv

List of 391 files that were manually scanned by human observers.

-----
StationMetadata.csv

Metadata related to the ARU and camera stations used in this study.

Station - Station ID.
Type - Whether the station had a camera or ARU.
Latitude - Latitude, decimal degrees.
Longitude - Longitude, decimal degrees.
Distance - Distance from nearest access point, in meters (not calculated for cameras, which were effectively at access points).
AccessPoint - ID of nearest access point.
StagingArea - ID of nearest of four major staging areas (not calculated for cameras, since no analysis conducted of this).
